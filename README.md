# Car-Part-Prediction

A Car Manufacturers needs to sell products; e.g. radio, GPS navigation, speekers, etc. for multiple years after they stop producing. The supplier for these manufacturers needs to keep enough parts avaiable for around 15-20 years, but production for these products end after a few years of production. If the supplier orders too many parts, this could lead to millions of dollars being lost in excess product. Or if the supplier orders too few, this could lead to lower profits and customer statisfaction.

The goal is to create a forecasting tool that will be able to predict the amount of parts needed to keep for these 15-20 years. The projects tries to find a correlation between the Mass Production of parts being sold to the number of serivce parts needed.
